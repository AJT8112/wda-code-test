      <h3>For this tech test I have completed finding the mean average of the below array that included both string and number data types.
        <p class="array">[3,7,'df','3',7,8,'df',23,6,2,67,'g','34',12,34,5]<p>
        <h3>To do this I completed the following steps;</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To increase robustness I validated my array to ensure that my JavaScript would only work for an array data structure.</li>
        <li>If the data structure passes array validation, then complete the function, otherwise return a statement saying that an incorrect data structure was added.</li>
        <li>If the item is an array then declare the variables for the start of the loop start at a value of 0.</li>
        <li>Then begin my JavaScript iterating through the array.</li>
        <li>Identify a variable to select the 'current' data under review.</li>
        <li>If the variable is a number then carry out the equation in step 7.</li>
        <li>make the variable sum equal what the 'current' data is, plus the new data from the array, this will provide the total sum of all numbers. By using Number() function it will also account for numbers if they are as a string data type.</li>
        <li>Identify the quantity of numbers that were added together by using increment number. </li>
        <li>Divide the total sum of all the numbers by the quantity of numbers used.</li>
        <li>Return the average (mean) value to 7 decimal places.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What do you think about how this was approached?</h3>
      <p class="textBackground">I would love to hear more about ways to improve / refine these steps taken, but now for the moment of truth ... DOES IT WORK??!!</p>
